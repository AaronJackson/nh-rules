Be Excellent To One Another
===========================

We ask that you respect others when using the Hackspace. Do this by **cleaning up after yourself**, abiding by our **safe spaces** [#]_ policy and **code of conduct** [#]_.

There are housekeeping tasks that always need doing, and can be completed by any member. Please see this wiki page for more details.

Please make yourself aware of our **grievance policy** [#]_.

Remember that the Hackspace is run by the volunteers for the members, and we ask that you be a **member not a consumer**. Donâ€™t be a greedy hacker.
